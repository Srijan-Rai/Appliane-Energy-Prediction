# Appliane-Energy-Prediction
In the modern era of development, energy plays a vital role for various households and industries. In todayâ€™s time, there are many places, especially in the developing world where there are outages. Hence having proper knowledge of energy consumption by various household appliances could help us to tackle such problems.

In this project, we will be building a Machine Learning model to predict the energy consumption of various appliances in an apartment.

The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters.

Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. 

Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non-predictive attributes
(parameters).
